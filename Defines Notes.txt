How Defines Work:
There are several groups of strings which are divided by the entry prefix.
Each group serves a purpose in the save editor UI.

Special Entries:
Metadata (prefix "Meta."):
- (String) Name: Name of the mod these defines are associated with.
- (String) Author: Name(s) of the author(s) of the defines.
Special Support (prefix "Special."):
- (Bool) MimHack: Adds support for the <MIM hack. Prevents the used flags from being edited
         in the flag UI and adds a new field for modifying the current costume ID. 
- (Bool) VarHack: Adds support for the <VAR (TSC+) hack. Prevents the used flags
         from being edited in the flag UI and adds a new tab for modifying the variables.
- (Bool) PhysVarHack: Adds support for the <PHY (TSC+ PHY addon) hack. Prevents the used flags
         from being edited in the flag UI and adds new fields modifying the physics variables.
