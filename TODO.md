# To-do list

- [ ] FIX NPCS!!!!!!
- [x] Clicking and releasing immediately without moving your cursor in the MapView window moves quote, and it also doesn't move him to where you clicked in the MapView. (it's far up/right from where you click)
- [ ] Still can't hold two arrows to move directionally in the MapView window.
- [x] You still gotta move your cursor at least one pixel before Quote moves to your cursor. This means that you can't just click.
- [ ] Scrollbar needs to be moveable by mouse.
- [ ] Read weapon and item names from TSC files.
